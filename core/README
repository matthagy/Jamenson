Builtin (core) functionality of Jamenson as provided in Jamenson.

Here we bootstrap the language through a series of steps to provide a
Scheme-ish language. We start with the basic language provided by
the python translator and use macros to build a full language.

See core.jms for the order in which core is loaded.

Additionally, the build.py script compiles all of the Jamenson
modules to accelerate loading.
