Overview
==========================================
Jamenson is a robust scheme implementation, including a full runtime, compiler, and libraries, for the Python programming language. This language allows Python programmers to write select portions of their applications in a scheme dialect using our many cherished lispy features; i.e. code-as-data and macros. Additionally, with the its feature-full optimizing compiler, Jamenson code runs atop the Python virtual machine and is commonly more efficient than comparable Python code. Current uses include code generators, such as a pattern matching compiler to transform declarative languages into efficient implementation functions. Future plans include partial static type analysis with the aim of compiling to machine code via an external c-compiler. Your comments and contributions are always more than welcome.
